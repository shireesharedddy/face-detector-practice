# Face Detector (Practice with OpenCV + Python)

This is a practice project where I practised with computer vision using OpenCV.  
It contains multiple Python programs that build on each other step by step.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The repo contains multiple Python files demonstrating: 

- `face_detection.py` â€“ Basic face detection
- `face_camera.py` â€“ Real-time camera face detection
- `FaceCamera.py` â€“ Detection with snapshots and timestamp overlay
- `FaceCounterCamera.py` â€“ Counts faces, adds bounding boxes, color variations
- `face_blur.py` â€“ Blurs detected faces

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Install OpenCV:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Run
```bash
python FaceCamera.py
```
Press q to quit, s to take snapshot (depending on script)

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/face-detector.git
cd face-detector
```
